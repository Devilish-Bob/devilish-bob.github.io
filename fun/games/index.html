            </p>
            <p>
                Has a vibrant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUt840BUOYA">speedrunning</a>, <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/284283">modding</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkoek2012">analyst</a> community.

                <b>Baba Is You (9/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Awesome puzzle game that broke my brain.
            </p>

                <b>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (9/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A game that's very scary yet not scary at the same time. Speaking of Zelda games, this one, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and a Link to the Past are the only good ones. Everything else is kind of meh. (Yes, including the "critically acclaimed" Breath of the Wild) Also, I hate the supposedly canon timeline.

            <p>
                <b>Minecraft (9/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The game that peaked in 2012 and gets worse with every new update. <a href="https://exozy.me/">exozyme</a> intermittently runs a server. </a><a href="https://github.com/Ta180m/multimc5-offline">PKGBUILD for Arch Linux.</a>

                <b>SuperTuxKart (8/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Really nice free and open-source racing game with lots of addons with local and online multiplayer. Dashie the Cyber Bunny is the best character! Graphics are kind of meh.

            <p>
                <b>Kerbal Space Program (8/10)</b>
            </p>
                You really can have fun building rockets and learn a lot about physics and orbital dynamics at the same time! The physics could be more accurate though.
            <p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Super Mario Maker 2 (8/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Great game you can use to build binary computers. Best enjoyed in an emulator.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Mother 3 (8/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the best RPGs out there. As always, the battle system kind of sucks. Also, there's animal abuse.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Wii Sports (8/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sports game that anyone can play.
            </p>

                <b>Hedgewars (7/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hilarious multiplayer battle game with too many weapons.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>The Powder Toy (7/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Great sandbox game, a bit like Minecraft but better in some ways. Open source! There's even a RetroArch core available for it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>FlightGear (7/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Really, really hard but ultra-realistic flight simulator game. Just try landing any plane. Open source too!
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>osu!lazer (6/10)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Open source <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">anime</span> rhythm game that I suck at. For Linux users, make sure PulseAudio (or Pipewire) is managing ALSA, or sound may not work and you'll have a bad time like I did.

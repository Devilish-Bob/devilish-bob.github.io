                <b>Super Mario 64</b>: Has a vibrant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUt840BUOYA">speedrunning</a>, <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/284283">modding</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkoek2012">analyst</a> community.

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Super Mario Maker 2</b>: Great game you can use to build binary computers. Best enjoyed in an emulator.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>The Legend of Zelda</b>: Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and a Link to the Past are the only good ones. Everything else is kind of meh. (Yes, including the "critically acclaimed" Breath of the Wild) Also, I hate the supposedly canon timeline.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Minecraft</b>: The game that peaked in 2012 and gets worse with every new update. <a href="https://exozy.me/">exozyme</a> intermittently runs a server. </a><a href="https://github.com/Ta180m/multimc5-offline">PKGBUILD for Arch Linux.</a>
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>FlightGear</b>: Really, really hard but ultra-realistic flight simulator game. Just try landing any plane. Open source too!
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Mother 3</b>: One of the best RPGs out there. As always, the battle system kind of sucks. Also, there's animal abuse.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>The Powder Toy</b>: Great sandbox game, a bit like Minecraft but better in some ways. Open source! There's even a RetroArch core available for it.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>SuperTuxKart</b>: Really nice open source racing game, with bad graphics.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>osu!</b>: Open source <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">anime</span> rhythm game that I suck at. Make sure PulseAudio (or Pipewire) is managing ALSA, or sound may not work and you'll have a bad time like I did.

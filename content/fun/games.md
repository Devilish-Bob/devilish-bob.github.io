### Super Mario 64 (10/10)

Has a vibrant [speedrunning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUt840BUOYA), [modding](https://gamebanana.com/mods/284283), and [analyst](https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkoek2012) community.
  
### Baba Is You (9/10)

Awesome puzzle game that broke my brain.

### The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (9/10)

A game that's very scary yet not scary at the same time. Speaking of Zelda games, this one, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and a Link to the Past are the only good ones. Everything else is kind of meh. (Yes, including the "critically acclaimed" Breath of the Wild) Also, I hate the supposedly canon timeline.

### Minecraft (9/10)

The game that peaked in 2012 and gets worse with every new update. [exozyme](https://exozy.me/) intermittently runs a server. [PKGBUILD for Arch Linux.](https://github.com/Ta180m/multimc5-offline)

### SuperTuxKart (8/10)

Really nice free and open-source racing game with lots of addons with local and online multiplayer. Dashie the Cyber Bunny is the best character! Graphics are kind of meh.

### Kerbal Space Program (8/10)

You really can have fun building rockets and learn a lot about physics and orbital dynamics at the same time! The physics could be more accurate though.

### BeamNG.drive (8/10)

Driving simulator with terrible controls but amazing crashes.

### Super Mario Maker 2 (8/10)

Great game you can use to build binary computers. Best enjoyed in an emulator.

### Mother 3 (8/10)

One of the best RPGs out there. As always, the battle system kind of sucks. Also, there's animal abuse.

### Wii Sports (8/10)

Sports game that anyone can play.

### Hedgewars (7/10)

Hilarious multiplayer battle game with too many weapons.

### The Powder Toy (7/10)

Great sandbox game, a bit like Minecraft but better in some ways. Open source! There's even a RetroArch core available for it.

### FlightGear (7/10)

Really, really hard but ultra-realistic flight simulator game. Just try landing any plane. Open source too!

### osu!lazer (6/10)

Open source anime rhythm game that I suck at. For Linux users, make sure PulseAudio (or Pipewire) is managing ALSA, or sound may not work and you'll have a bad time like I did.

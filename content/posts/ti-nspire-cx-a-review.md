The TI-Nspire series, a long list of graphing calculators used by children all over the world. Either stuffed in your backpack or sitting by your math homework, it’s essential to [i]tout le monde[/i].

[b][size=150]Design[/size][/b]

[u][b]Size[/b][/u]
The TI-Nspire CX is 19.2 × 9.1 × 1.9  (L × W × H CM). At only 242 grams, it's lightweight and extremely portable. Though, to new users, it may seem a bit large, but when you see other graphing calculators, you’ll be thankful. 

[u][b]Color[/b][/u]
The TI-Nspire CX comes in its normal black and white configuration and in a “school bus yellow” configuration. The normal black and white configuration comes with a white exterior and a white interior. The case is black and stamped with [i]Texas Instruments[/i].

[u][b]School Bus Yellow[/b][/u]
The “school bus yellow” configuration, a configuration that makes the white parts of the calculators “school bus yellow”, is available in packs of ten, amounting to an outstanding total of 1800 dollars, without sales tax. With this pack of ten, you get 10 “school bus yellow” calculators , a “school bus yellow” docking station, one 90-day trial for Nspire teacher software, and one TI-Nspire poster.

[u][b]Ports[/b][/u]
There are three ports. Two on the top and one on the bottom. The long rectangular port is the port that is used for the Wireless TI-Nspire Navigator Adapter. This attaches to your calculator using the mentioned port and lets your teacher, monitor what’s on your display, show you their own display, and give instructions. There are two generations of this adapter, the first one communicating only on the 2.4GHz band and the second one communicating on the 2.4GHZ or the 5.0GHz band.
Enough about the special port, let’s move on to the other port on the top, the mini-USB port. This port can charge the computer with the included charging cable and it can also transfer files with TI-Nspire Computer Link software. 
The bottom port charges the calculator if you plug it into a docking station.

[u][b]Display[/b][/u]
The TI-Nspire CX has a 320*240 LCD display with 76800 pixels. Each pixel can display 16 colors; 4 levels of red, 4 levels of blue, 4 levels of green, and 4 levels of transparency. The display is very bright though the colors are a bit pale. The bezels are a bit large, but not something you can't get used to.
Also, the display is padded with foam, so it can resist shock and falls. A smart move by Texas Instruments, considering that these calculators are used by kids...

[size=150][b]Performance[/b][/size]

[u][b]Battery[/b][/u]
The TI-Nspire CX features a new, rechargeable, lithium-ion battery with 1300 mAh. According to TI’s website, the battery is supposed to last for three years under normal use.
The one I have, bought during spring of 2015, still has about a week’s worth of battery life - even when I’m playing games.

[u][b]Charging[/b][/u]
You charge the battery with the included mini-USB cable, wall charger, or a TI-Nspire Docking Station. However, I would recommend using the normal USB cable as its small, lightweight, and portable.
The TI-Nspire docking station is only good if you have more than 5 TI-Nspires. It can charge 10 calculators in six hours, which is pretty fast considering that it’s connected to the wall with only one AC adapter, though pointless unless you have a lot of Nspires.

[b]Design:[/b] 8/10

Comments: Does everything you paid for it to do, and some more.

[b]Practicality:[/b] 8.5/10
Comments: Keyboard is a bit cramped.

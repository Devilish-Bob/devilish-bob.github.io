Based on the competitive browser soccer game, Slime Volleyball is a simple game for your TI-Nspire! With the power of playing volleyball, guide your slime to beat the opposing slime five times, and win the match! On the way, you’ll find different colored slimes, more different colored slimes, and even more different colored slimes! Though the design and idea is quite simple, this is a straightforward, and relatively fun game to add to your Nspire.

[b]Design: 7/10[/b]
Simple, a bit boring. 

[b]Functionality: 8/10[/b]
Plain old volleyball. 
Though, you can change color by pressing [TAB](Player 1) or [DEL](Player 2).

[b]Practicality: 6/10[/b]
One player controls are easy to use, two player controls are [b]really[/b] hard to use.
Keep in mind that you cannot hold a button to continuously move, you have to spam it.

[b]Performance: 8/10[/b]
Between borderline and acceptable. (27-33 FPS)

[b]Overall: 7/10[/b]
Your average Lua game. Not as good as [url=https://www.superslimesoccer.io/play]Super Slime Soccer[/url] but decent enough if you’re bored in math.

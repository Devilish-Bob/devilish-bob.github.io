I don't know about you, but where the heck is all my time going?

At the beginning of the summer (OK fine, two thirds of the way through technically, and southern hemisphere people don't kill me), I made a big list of things I wanted to accomplish by the end. I've accomplished 11 out of the 23 tasks. Amazing, nearly 50% already!

Nope! I finished the 11 easiest tasks. Some of those things took like 10 minutes. Procrastination is the most efficient way to sort tasks. That's like the only thing procrastination is efficient at.

Now for the remaining 12 tasks, there are quite a few that I have no doubt I wouldn't finish even if you told me I would have to drink [buffalo wing ranch dressing soda](http://www.thepizzle.net/do-not-drink-5-terrible-sodas-that-taste-like-hell-on-earth/) (I like that blog post way too much...) if I failed to complete the task. They're just too hard. OK, screw those.

However, there are a few other tasks like finishing the LadueCS anime mascot that are very doable! I just don't have time to do them.

What??? But you have a whole summer and finishing the mascot takes max 20 hours!

Yes, that's right, but 20 hours is a long time. I'd be lucky if I have one free hour each day to work on it. And I'm usually way more efficient if I devote a solid three or four hours straight so I don't need to remember where I left off last time when I worked on it a week ago. Also, I don't really know how to use Krita ðŸ˜³.

So here's what I'm going to do tomorrow: armed with a watch and a notepad, I'll faithfully record everything I do and at what time (I'm going to be reasonable here and not record every microaction that I complete, of course). Then, we'll crunch the numbers. (And also I'm supposed to finish an a set of essays for something else tonight but somehow I'm on track to have enough time to finish both that and this blog post!) Stay tuned!

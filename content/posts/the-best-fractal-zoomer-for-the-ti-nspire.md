This fractal zoomer for the TI-Nspire CX outshines any other fractal zoomer. It utilizes the 320x240 color LCD screen to provide a meticulous level of detail. This fractal zoomer supports the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set, and even your own custom fractal function! The rendering is relatively fast, at least for a calculator, and the program supports eight colorings and various other settings to provide a unique experience unrivaled by practically any other fractal zoomer. Perhaps the only downside may be the unresponsive cursor of the TI-Nspire, but that’s the hardware’s fault. Fortunately, no Ndless is required!

Nice graphics!

[b]Functionality: 10/10[/b]
Tons of configuration settings to mess around with!

[b]Practicality: 9/10[/b]
A great source of entertainment during math class

[b]Performance: 8/10[/b]
Even though the rendering is quite fast, it can’t compete with a computer

[b]Overall: 9/10[/b]
Probably the best fractal zoomer on any calculator!

The single most important piece of FOSS news that I've seen in years just dropped earlier this week. Yes, this is more important than KDE's 25th Anniversary release, Lenovo's OEM Linux laptops, the Steam Deck, and the Pinephone. [Gitea is joining the fediverse!](https://social.gitea.io/@gitea/107576791626052697)

OK, not quite yet. They did get [a ton of funding](https://nlnet.nl/project/Gitea/) though, so let's hope it's [implemented quickly](https://mastodon.online/@dachary/107587577897660323). Maybe by the end of the year?

So why is this important? This seems like big news, but is it really all that important? There's barely any actual federation code yet for Gitea, so what's all the excitement about this?

To understand this better, think about all the proprietary sites that you use heavily on a daily basis. For me, I've gotten it down to only DuckDuckGo (soon to be replaced with SearX maybe?), Wolfram|Alpha (it's just *so* good), and GitHub. Basically all FOSS projects are on GitHub. You *have* to have a GitHub account. [Currently, Gitea simply can't compete with GitHub](https://baturin.org/blog/code-hosting-needs-federation/). [But it needs to](https://staticadventures.netlib.re/blog/decentralized-forge/). That's where this news comes in.

As for my GitHub account, I'm planning on migrating my personal projects to [exogit](https://git.exozy.me) soon-ish, so sometime in the near future. (I have about 50 of them, so I'll do it over a long weekend. I've already migrated [this website's repo](https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/website) to exogit!) I'm also planning on hosting this website on [exozyme](ta180m.exozy.me) with GitHub pages as a backup mirror, instead of the other way around as it currently is. For collaborative projects, I'll probably wait until Gitea starts actually supporting federation in their nightly releases. Hopefully, we won't have to wait long!

*Originally posted on my [old old old blog](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1991259_new_blog_coming_soon)*


It's been 5000 visits and nine months since the last blog post, and many of you may have been wondering what I've been doing. Well, you won't have to wait much longer! I'm currently working on a new blog, which will be made public on [b]February 3rd[/b], so be sure to mark that date on your calendars.


So what will this new blog be about? Well, I've always wanted to expand this blog to explore topics other than just calculators, but I've never really had the time. This new blog will give me the chance to do exactly that. After all, my interests are not only limited to calculators, as presented below in this collage that I quickly made in 30 minutes in Google Drawings.

Hopefully, with this new blog, I'll be able to explain the backstory behind each and every one of those pictures. Right now, I'm mostly working on completely rewriting a new CSS for the new blog, but it should be up and running on February 3rd.

Yes, the news is true.

[size=120][b]This blog is dead.[/b][/size]

But ...

I'm working on a new blog which you can find at [url=https://ta180m.github.io/]here[/url]. It's still in its early stages right now, but hopefully, I can follow through on this and not procrastinate and finally have an undead blog!


[size=120][b]So you might have a few questions:[/b][/size]

[b]Why [url=https://pages.github.com/]GitHub Pages[/url] and [url=https://jekyllrb.com/]Jekyll[/url] instead of an AoPS blog? Doesn't AoPS have so many more features?[/b]

Well, currently yes, but that doesn't mean I can't implement these features myself. Most importantly, GitHub Pages and Jekyll gives me orders of magnitude more flexibility than AoPS, where all that I can customize is the CSS. I can't change structurally how an AoPS blog works on the inside, only its aesthetics. Jekyll gives me enough structure so that I'm not completely lost in making my blog, but enough creative flexibility that I can tweak all aspects of the blog to make it work the way that I want.

[b]Where have you been? Did you get COVID-19? Are you dead?[/b]

As far as I can tell, I'm still alive. I just put this project on the back burner due to so much other stuff that's been going on in my life. Just look at my [url=https://github.com/Ta180m]GitHub profile[/url]: I've been occupied since mid-April working on various GitHub projects. I wrote an [url=https://github.com/Ta180m/BadNES]NES emulator[/url]. I'm in the process of renovating and expanding my [url=https://github.com/Ta180m/Library]competitive programming library[/url]. I [url=https://github.com/Ta180m/Infectious-Disease-Modeling]modeled infectious diseases[/url] like SARS and COVID-19. I created a Docker container that creates [url=https://github.com/Ta180m/Arch-All-the-Way-Down]arbitrarily nested Docker containers[/url] (This one's really fun! Try running it on your computer with a nesting depth of 10). I also wrote [url=https://gist.github.com/Ta180m/]a few Gists[/url] that you can also check out.

[b]Why should I believe that your new blog won't just die like this one?[/b]

Uh ... well, no guarantees about that ... Anyways, this is a project that I've been really wanting to work on for several months now, I've just never had the time. I'm entirely confident that this new blog, with enough time an effort, will blossom into a nice collection of ramblings and essays. It'll be great. Just wait ... um ... another month?

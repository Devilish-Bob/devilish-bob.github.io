With this post, I'm hitting a major and rather arbitrary milestone: 100 blog posts!

Now you're probably thinking, there are way less than 100 posts published on this website and that claim above is completely false, and you'd actually be correct.

However, I use the command `ls content/posts | wc -l` to count my number of posts, which just so happens to include drafts and unpublished stuff as well. There probably isn't anything worth reading among all those drafts, and some of them are from my old blog or old old blog or old old old blog that I unpublished because the didn't quite hit the mark in terms of quality.

Anyways, the next milestone's at 128 posts, right? ðŸ˜ƒ

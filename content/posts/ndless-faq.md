[i]See [url]https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1708491_ndless_jailbreak_your_tinspire[/url] for a full tutorial on installing Ndless, a TI-Nspire jailbreaking software.[/i]


[b]Q: Help! I tried installing Ndless, but my calculator restarted and the "Ndless installed!" thing in the top left didn't come![/b]

A: First check your OS to make sure you are installing the right version of Ndless. To check your operating system version, press [ON] - [5] - [4]. When you transfer the Ndless files to your calculator, make sure you send the correct files for your calculator's OS!
Also make sure that "ndless" is a top level folder.

[b]Q: Darn! I bricked my calculator while using Ndless! My parents will be so mad![/b]

A: You should first try restarting your calculator by pressing the restart button on the back. If that doesn't work, try reinstalling your calculator's OS using the [url=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1708394_tinspire_computer_link]TI-Nspire Computer Link[/url].


[b]Q: My calculator's feeling a bit slow. Should I get [url=https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/434/43428.html]Nover 3[/url]?[/b]

A: Get Nover 3 at your own risk. According to the readme.txt file:
[quote]NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS DANGEROUS AND MIGHT PERMANENTLY BRICK YOUR CALCULATOR IS USED INCORRECTLY.
YOU SHOULD BACKUP ALL YOUR DATA BEFORE INSTALLING IT.
ACCORDING TO THE LICENCE, USING THIS PROGRAM DOES VOID YOUR WARRANTY TOO.
Use it wisely.[/quote]

[b]Q: Oh no! I accidentally corrupted my calculator's memory! What should I do?[/b]

A: This sounds like a job for the maintenance menu. To access the TI-Nspire CX's maintenance menu, first turn your calculator off. Then, press [DOC][EE][ENTER], and while holding these keys, use a pen to press the (Reset) button on the back of your calculator.

You will have then be given four choices:
- Cancel: This option makes no changes except to reboot the handheld. This is the safest option.
- Delete Operating System: If you choose this, you will have to install your OS again using the TI-Nspire Computer Link.
- Delete Document Folder contents: This is exactly like pressing (Reset) on the back of the calculator. All documents are deleted, but you don't need to reinstall your OS.
- Complete format: This is the most powerful reset available on the TI-Nspire. All documents are deleted and you will need to reinstall your OS.


[b]Q: Does Ndless void my warranty?[/b]

A: Yes. Be very careful with Ndless. It shouldn't be dangerous, but you can still corrupt your system memory or something. According to the [url=https://education.ti.com/en-ph/customer-support/warranty-and-service]TI-Nspire warranty[/url]:
[quote]This warranty is void if the product has been damaged by accident, unreasonable use, neglect, improper service, or other causes not arising from defects in material or workmanship.[/quote]

[b]Q: I don't want to risk it anymore! How do I uninstall Ndless?[/b]

A: Open the ndless_resources.tns file on your calculator. Your calculator should then reboot. If the green text in the corner of the home screen is gone, then Ndless should be uninstalled.


[b]Q: I reset my calculator, and for some reason, I don't see the green text anymore![/b]

A: Ndless has been uninstalls everytime you restart your calculator. You can reinstall it by opening the ndless_installer.tns file.

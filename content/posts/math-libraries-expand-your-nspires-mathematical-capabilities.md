Feeling limited by your Nspire's mathematical capabilities? Wondering why your Nspire's missing important math (or programming) functions? Well, what you need is a math library! The TI-Nspire CX CAS comes with two libraries, linalgcas and numtheory, which add useful matrix and number theory operations, but can we do more? The attached zip file includes seven more libraries, offering tons of algebra, geometry, and list functions and operations!

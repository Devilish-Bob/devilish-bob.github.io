Based on the, [i]2010 side scrolling platform game [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Guy]here[/url] [/i], Gravity Guy is a must-have for your TI-Nspire! With the power of inverting gravity, you have the get Gravity Guy to the green portal at the end of each level. On the way, you’ll find different colored blocks, more different colored blocks, and more different colored blocks! Though the design is simple and the idea is elementary, this is a highly addicting game that's sure to glue your eyes to your calculator.

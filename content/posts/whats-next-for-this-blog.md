*Originally posted on my [old old old blog](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1820480_whats_next_for_this_blog)*


This blog has been long overdue for another post, and you're all probably wondering, what's next for this blog?

 - More reviews of games and applications: I have a backlog of unfinished reviews that I'll post over the next few days.
 - A review of the newly announced [url=https://education.ti.com/en/bulletinboard/nspire]TI-Nspire CX II[/url]
 - An analysis of why exactly graphing calculators are so expensive
 - Other topics?

Please comment if you have any other suggestions!

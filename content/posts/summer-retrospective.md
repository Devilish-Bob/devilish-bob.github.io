For me, summer 2022 started on May 12. I knew I didn't want to waste it, so I made a huge kanban board with all the things I wanted to accomplish over the summer.

My summer ends on August 23. 103 days total. I totally feel like I wasted it, but a quick glance at the board tells me I either got really good at checking things off the list, or I actually did a bunch of stuff. Or maybe both. Anyways, here's the full list, plus a few other bonus items that I didn't include on the board, but are still noteworthy:

- I finished writing [Intro to Python](https://codeberg.org/LadueCS/Intro-to-Python), although I still need some people to check over and review it to ensure it's not filled with egregious typos.

- I got a new [laptop](/posts/laptopia) which was quite a rollercoaster ride which you can read more about

- I finished all my remaining high school related timewaster stuff, like graduation, some stupid assignments since seniors got out two weeks earlier than everyone else but some of my classes still had some stupid assignments.

- [exozyme v8.3](https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/releases/tag/v8.3).

- I tried a bunch of tactics for reducing distractions which [I wrote about earlier](effectiveness-physical-notebook). Did they work? Kinda, but I still have a ton of room for improvement.

- I [copied all the blog posts from my old blogs](https://git.exozy.me/a/website/issues/1) to my current website, which took forever.

- I downloaded my account data from my Google accounts and deleted all of them except one.

- My family went on a long vacation to Yellowstone, which was a much-needed relaxing experience.

- I applied for an MIT FPOP pre-orientation program and got into the material sciences one, which I'm not too interested in, but it should be a lot of fun.

- I migrated all the LadueCS repos from GitHub to Codeberg and deleted the GitHub copies.

- I deleted a bunch of old accounts that I don't use, like Replit, Pastebin, Kaggle, Reddit, GitLab, and a bunch of other ones that I already forgot.

- I made backups of the SD cards of my homebrewed video game consoles and put the consoles into storage somewhere deep inside my house, since I don't use them anymore.

- I wrote a ton of blog posts.

- I streamed Gitea federation development to show how terrible of a Go programmer I am.

- I met up with some old friends which was a ton of fun.

- I started making a [digital garden](https://git.exozy.me/a/DAG), but it hasn't gone very far yet.

- I deleted my GitHub repos except for 4 and made exogit the primary hosting site for them.

- [exozyme v8.4](https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/releases/tag/v8.4).

- [exozyme v8.5](https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/releases/tag/v8.5).

- I wrote a [short story](/posts/hitchhikers-guide-to-arch-linux) about the LadueCS lore.

- Along with smolshep, we finished designing and drawing the LadueCS anime girl mascot using [Krita](	/posts/thinkpads-anime-apt-moo), which was a brutal 90 days of fun.

- I designed a [minimal music programming language](https://git.exozy.me/a/M) but haven't had time yet to implement it.

- I figured out that I don't need to register to vote in Missouri and can instead do it in Massachusetts.

- [exozyme v8.6](https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/releases/tag/v8.6).

- I made some more short stories with smolshep.

- I finished teaching an online programming class in mid-July.

- I revived and revamped the [ebooks bot](https://git.exozy.me/a/ebooks), but I shut it down since it was kinda annoying.

- I continued trying to improve my concentration and reduce distractions.

- [exozyme v8.7](https://git.exozy.me/exozyme/exozyme/releases/tag/v8.7.

- I took 4 exams for testing out of MIT classes.

- I worked on Gitea federation and ForgeFed quite a lot throughout the summer, but more work still needs to be done.

- I switched my main text editor to Micro and fixed a copy-paste related bug.

- I learned some more linear algebra for machine learning purposes, obviously.

- exozyme has a lot more active members now ðŸ˜ƒ.

- I became a maintainer of the [MIT Mastodon instance](https://mastodon.mit.edu).

There are probably more things that I can't think of, but yeah, it's quite a lot.

Sometimes, I feel like I wasted the whole summer and didn't accomplish much for Gitea federation, but I was quite busy actually, and plus I did actually do a lot for Gitea, but it's such a large project that in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't seem like much.

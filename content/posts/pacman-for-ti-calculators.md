[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man]Pac-man[/url], first released in 1980 by Namco, is absolute classic arcade game. Now you can enjoy Pac-man on your TI-84 Plus CE calculator! Featuring authentic graphics and a high-score system, this game is a must-have for your calculator. Download Pac-Man for your TI-84 Plus CE [url=https://www.ticalc.org/pub/84plusce/asm/games/pacmance.zip]here[/url]

If you have a TI-Nspire, you can still play Pac-Man using the download link below, but personally, I recommend the TI-84 Plus CE version. [url=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1708491_ndless_jailbreak_your_tinspire]Ndless[/url] is NOT required for the TI-Nspire version.

Recently, chess has seen a resurgence in my school. But what if you want to play chess during math class? Well, ChessCE for your TI-84 Plus CE is the answer. In addition to playing against your friends, you can also play against ChessCE's own built-in AI, or even watch the AI play against itself! And of course, games can be saved and loaded.

sad that Jackie Chan is a CCP supporter

I still believe Bruce Lee's death was an inside job by Jackie Chan

Dragon Ball the anime/manga was inspired by Bruce Lee films, including the name

in real life, dragons would be unlikely to actually have balls because evolution was cause them to lose external genitals to be more aerodynamic

for instance, dolphins have a slit on their belly to stow away their penis when not in use to be more hydrodynamic in the water

in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, dolphins are said to be secretly more intelligent than humans and manage to save the earth from destruction by aliens

the number 42 is commonly said to be the answer to life the universe and everything, but that just proves you haven't actually read the Hitchhiker's Guide because the actual menaing of 42 in that book is more nuanced

The ASCII code 42 is for the asterisk symbol, being a wildcard for everything.

Some people (that don't actually know regular expressions) believe that the asterisk is the wildcard symbol, but in regex the period is actually the wildcard (the asterisk is the kleene star)

some day, I want to make a knockoff of Keemstar called Kleenestar but only CS nerds would get it

Ah man Wikipedia managed to do that in fewer steps

Tired of the same old games on your TI-Nspire? Want additional functionality for your calculator, or to program in C or Python directly on your calculator? Well, Ndless is the perfect application for you!


[size=120][b]What is Ndless?[/b][/size]

Ndless is a jailbreaking application that enables your TI-Nspire calculator to run native programs, such as C, JavaScript, Python, and ARM assembly programs. In addition, Ndless will vastly expand your calculator's functionality, from PDF viewers 
 to Linux to [url=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1708328_gameboy_advance_emulation_for_the_tinspire]Gameboy Advance emulators[/url]. To see a complete list of Ndless Apps, visit [url]https://ndless-apps.org/[/url].

[u][b]Before You Start[/b][/u]
If installed properly, Ndless should not damage your calculator. However, given the potential risks, it's recommended that you back up your calculator's files.
Also, you will need to download the [url=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c726379h1708394_tinspire_computer_link]TI-Nspire Computer Link[/url] software to transfer files to your calculator.

[u][b]Check Your OS[/b][/u]
To check your operating system version, press [ON] - [5] - [4]. When you transfer the Ndless files to your calculator, make sure you send the correct files for your calculator's OS!

[u][b]Preparation[/b][/u]
1. Download [url=https://tiplanet.org/modules/archives/download.php?id=44445]Ndless[/url] and extract the archived content.
2. On your calculator, create a top-level folder called “ndless”.
3. In this folder, transfer the ndless_resources.tns file and the ndless_installer_X.X.X.tns file for your OS from the extracted archive to your calculator using the TI-Nspire Computer Link.

[i]Note: You can also transfer the ndless.cfg.tns file to handle extensions association.[/i]

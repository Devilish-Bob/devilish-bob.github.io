The [url=https://education.ti.com/en/bulletinboard/nspire]TI-Nspire CX II[/url] has been announced, and it’s a disappointment. While it does include a faster processor and an updated case and user interface, very little has changed since the release of the first Nspire CX eight years ago. It’s basically the old CX with a new processor and OS in a new case. Much of the [url=https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-nspire-cx-ii-cx-ii-cas/specifications]specifications page[/url] is just a direct copy and paste from the first model. Even worse, the RAM in this new model is 10 MB less than the original CX. While few users would need so much RAM, introducing a model with more RAM would have paved the way for more resource-intensive emulators. While TI could have spent eight years developing a new, innovative calculator, instead, they chose to upgrade a few features of the CX and package it in a new case. TI's monopoly on the graphing calculator market allows it to make innovations at a snail's pace while making huge profits. Overall, the TI-Nspire CX II is really just a modest upgrade of the CX.

Comments:
Different sources disagree about the screen size, the official announcement page gives it as 3.5", although it’s more likely to be 3.2”
90 MB storage memory: A downgrade from the CX
396 MHz processor speed: 2.5x faster than the CX, may go up to 500 MHz with overclocking

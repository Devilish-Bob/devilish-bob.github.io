## Penelope

Set to the tune of ["Developers Developers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE):

```
Penelope envelope microscope cantelope,
Telescope gyroscope periscope spectroscope,
Horoscope antelope endoscope fluoroscope,
Gastroscope chronoscope allotrope I need to pee.
```

If the song didn't sound right, you're pronouncing the words correctly.


## Never Gonna Blow You Up

Set to the tune of the theme song of the internet:

```
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna blow you up
Never gonna gun you down
Never gonna turn you round and assault you
Never gonna make you die
Never gonna gouge your eye
Never gonna boil you alive and eat you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna blow you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna turn you round and assault you
Never gonna make you die
Never gonna gouge your eye
Never gonna boil you alive and eat you

Never gonna blow you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna turn you round and assault you
Never gonna make you die
Never gonna gouge your eye
Never gonna boil you alive and eat you

(Ooh, blow you up)
(Ooh, blow you up)
(Ooh) Never gonna blow, never gonna blow (blow you up)
(Ooh) Never gonna blow, never gonna blow (blow you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (to say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna blow you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna turn you round and assault you
Never gonna make you die
Never gonna gouge your eye
Never gonna boil you alive and eat you

Never gonna blow you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna turn you round and assault you
Never gonna make you die
Never gonna gouge your eye
Never gonna boil you alive and eat you

Never gonna blow you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna turn you round and assault you
Never gonna make you die
Never gonna gouge your eye
Never gonna boil you alive and eat you
```

Sing this to you romantic partner, it works 100% guarenteed.

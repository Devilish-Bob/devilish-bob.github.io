# 102 Processing ([WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV); RFC 2518)

A WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, requiring a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[3] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

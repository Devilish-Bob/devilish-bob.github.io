Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of [digital cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cash) or [micropayment scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment), as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler, but that has not yet happened, and this code is not widely used. [Google Developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Developers) API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests. [Sipgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipgate) uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call. [Shopify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify) uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is temporarily disabled. [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)) uses this code for failed payments where parameters were correct, for example blocked fraudulent payments.<br /><br />[<-- Back](../../http_codes.md)

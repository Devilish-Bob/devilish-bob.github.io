title: "401 Unauthorized"
type: page
---
Similar to [403 Forbidden](403.md), but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and [Digest access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication). [401](401.md) semantically means "unauthorised", the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.Some sites incorrectly issue [HTTP 401](401.md) when an [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website.<br /><br />[<-- Back](../../http_codes.md)

# 414 URI Too Long

The [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI) provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request. Called "Request-URI Too Long" previously in RFC 2616.

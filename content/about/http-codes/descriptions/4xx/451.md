# 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons (RFC 7725)

A server operator has received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the requested resource. The code 451 was chosen as a reference to the novel [Fahrenheit 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451) (see the Acknowledgements in the RFC).

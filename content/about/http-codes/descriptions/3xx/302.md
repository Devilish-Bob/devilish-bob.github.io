title: "302 Found (Previously \"Moved Temporarily\")"
type: page

Tells the client to look at (browse to) another URL. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect with the same method (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 redirects by changing the method to GET. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes [303](303) and [307](307) to distinguish between the two behaviours.<br /><br />[<-- Back](../../)

# 308 Permanent Redirect

This and all future requests should be directed to the given [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier). [308](308.md) parallel the behaviour of [301](301.md), but does not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.

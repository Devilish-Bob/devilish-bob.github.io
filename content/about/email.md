I hate spam. Prove you are not a robot by computing the sum of the totients of the first 24 integers. Then concatenate that after the symbol of the 73rd element and add the character with ASCII value of 109. The domain is [pm.me](https://protonmail.com/). If you can, please use [PGP](https://mailvelope.com) with [my public key](/about/ta180m.asc).

## Top 10

1. **Super Mario 64 (10/10)**: The game itself is phenomenal. But what makes this game a 10/10 is how the fan base has kept it alive and thriving over the years, whether it's [speedrunning the game by visiting parallel universes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUt840BUOYA) or [mods that increase its awesomeness](https://gamebanana.com/mods/284283).

2. **Minecraft (9/10)**: The game that peaked in 2012 and gets worse with every new update. [exozyme](https://exozy.me/) intermittently runs a server.

3. **Baba Is You (9/10)**: This puzzle game broke my brain. OK, most of the levels are not difficult, but there are some real stumpers out there. What this game does so well is taking a single, simple concept, and turning it into a world of hundreds of levels that don't get old as you play through the game.

4. **SuperTuxKart (9/10)**: Unlike many of the other games on this list, SuperTuxKart is free and open source! So what does that even mean for the player? Well, you can read the source code (it's nicely commented) and see for yourself if the AI is really cheating! It's also very friendly to modding and addons, and you can even contribute to its development. As for simply enjoying the game, the local and online multiplayer makes it a real blast! Dashie the Cyber Bunny is the best character! The graphics are kind of meh, but whatever.

5. **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (9/10)**: A game that's very scary yet not scary at the same time. (Play it and you'll know what I mean.) Speaking of Zelda games, this one, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and a Link to the Past are the only good ones. Everything else is kind of meh. (Yes, including the "critically acclaimed" Breath of the Wild) Also, I hate the supposedly canon timeline.

6. **Kerbal Space Program (9/10)**: This game is a real blast! (No pun intended) It's really possible to have fun building rockets and learn a lot about physics and orbital dynamics at the same time! I learned more from playing this game during my high school Aerospace Engineering class than my from that class. The physics could be more accurate though, such as using proper N-body simulations instead of the patched conic approximation. KSP 2 is supposed to launch soon too! (OK, maybe that pun was intended)

7. **BeamNG.drive (8/10)**: A driving simulator with terrible controls but amazing crashes. It's best enjoyed with an actual steering wheel but game controllers will kinda work.

8. **Super Mario Maker 2 (8/10)**: Great game you can use to build binary computers. Best enjoyed in an emulator.

9. **Mother 3 (8/10)**: One of the best RPGs out there. As always, the battle system kind of sucks. Also, there's animal abuse.

10. **Wii Sports (8/10)**: A really fun game that pretty much anyone can play. I have way too many memories playing this game as a kid...


## Honorable mentions

- **Portal (8/10)**: A puzzle game. The puzzles are a bit too easy in my opinion and the entire game is way too short, but it's obviously the better of the two Portal games.

- **Hedgewars (7/10)**: Hilarious multiplayer battle game with too many weapons.

- **The Powder Toy (7/10)**: Great sandbox game, a bit like Minecraft but better in some ways. Open source! There's even a RetroArch core available for it.

- **FlightGear (7/10)**: Really, really hard but ultra-realistic flight simulator game. Just try landing any plane. Open source too!

- **osu!lazer (6/10)**: Open source anime rhythm game that I suck at. For Linux users, make sure PulseAudio (or Pipewire) is managing ALSA, or sound may not work and you'll have a bad time like I did.

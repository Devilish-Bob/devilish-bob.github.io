## Top 10

1. **Super Mario 64 (10/10)**: Although this game was released in 1996, it's still a blast to play today. Yes, the camera is incredibly janky, and yes, the low-poly models can't compete with the graphics in modern games, but the excitement and joy of exploring an open-world sandbox is something that doesn't age. But what makes this game a 10/10 for me is how the community has kept it alive and thriving over all these years. The mindblowing fastest known speedrun of the game mixes [computer science, physics, and parallel universes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUt840BUOYA). You can explore the [source code](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) due to the meticulous work of reverse-engineers. There are more [ROM hacks](https://sm64romhacks.com/) than you can play in a lifetime. And [pannenkoek2012's amazing videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMm211NGh4Ls5SAMZJF7E8A) have made Super Mario 64 analysis more scientific than some real scientific fields!

2. **SuperTuxKart (9/10)**: My appreciation for SuperTuxKart over time increases logarithmically. Seriously. For a game completely created by unpaid volunteers, it's absolutely stunning. Since it's free and open source, you can read the source code (it's nicely commented) and see for yourself if the AI is really cheating. SuperTuxKart is also incredibly friendly to modding and addons, and it's easy to contribute to its development. As for simply enjoying the game, it handles local, LAN, and online multiplayer extremely smoothly, so you can get together your friends and have loads of fun.

3. **Minecraft (8/10)**: Yeah, Minecraft peaked in 2012 and gets worse with every new update. Minetest is allegedly pretty good but I haven't tried it yet.

4. **Baba Is You (8/10)**: This puzzle game broke my brain. OK, most of the levels are not difficult, but there are some real stumpers out there. What this game does so well is taking a single, simple concept, and turning it into a world of hundreds of levels that don't get old as you play through the game. Admittedly, many of the later levels are hard simply because there are so many different elements in the puzzle all interacting with each other that you can't keep track of them.

5. **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (8/10)**: A game that's very scary yet not scary at the same time. (Play it and you'll know what I mean.) By the way, I'm not a Breath of the Wild fan, and don't provoke me to rant about it.

6. **Kerbal Space Program (8/10)**: This game is a real blast! (No pun intended) It's really possible to have fun building rockets and learn a lot about physics and orbital dynamics at the same time! I learned more from playing this game during my high school Aerospace Engineering class than from the class itself. The physics could be more accurate though, such as using proper N-body simulations instead of the patched conic approximation, but it's a good compromise between accuracy and difficulty.

7. **Mother 3 (8/10)**: One of the best RPGs out there. As always, the battle system sucks. Also, there's animal abuse. Best enjoyed in RetroArch with the xBRZ Freescale shader.

8. **Super Mario Maker 2 (7/10)**: I built binary computers with this.

9. **Wii Sports (7/10)**: A really fun game that pretty much anyone can play. I have way too many memories playing this as a kid...

10. **Oh My Git! (7/10)**: I legitimately learned Git by playing this game. Well yeah, I knew some basic Git already, but it does a wonderful job of visually representing what's going on, which is especially helpful for learning things like the dreaded `git merge`. Really shows how powerful games can be for learning new things!

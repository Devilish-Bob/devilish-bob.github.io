the heir to the trone of a sentient dodecahedron.

still learning how to master code and domunate the world.

sleeping with 1/9 probability.

[coding](/projects).

(i know what to put here, but i dont want to put it here).

"enjoying" my life in St. Louis, Misery (er... Missouri).


[wasting time](games) the most efficient way possible.

trying to master [algorithmic wizardry](/projects/competitive-programming).

building a [community](https://devilish-bob.github.io/about/books/).

pretending like I know [$SOME_RANDOM_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE](languages).

trying to find time to actually read real [books](books).

making code forges [talk to each other](https://nlnet.nl/project/Gitea/).

creating a compilation of hilariously useless (and fun!) [quotes](quotes).

trapped inside [vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/hssui9/comment/fych9dq/).

permanently incapable of drawing just about anything whatsoever (exept maybe a few planes).

faithfully cataloguing my [horde](hardware).

training neural networks to [vomit garbage](https://social.exozy.me/@ebooks/).

looking up images online of chevrotains, jerboas, Tibetan foxes, Pallas's cats, potoos,alpacas, and f-15s, which you should too, because it will instantly make your day better.

[breaking Arch Linux machines](/posts/installing-every-arch-package/).

running [docker inside docker inside docker inside docker](https://git.exozy.me/a/Arch-All-the-Way-Down).

destroying GitHub by being a noob.

getting roasted for my terrible [software stack](software).
seeding this website with tons of [secret easter eggs](puzzle).

amazed that special patterns in my biological neural networks transcribed into UTF-8 encoded strings in Markdown documents converted into HTML by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Gokarna theme](https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna) deployed to [exozyme](https://exozy.me) using [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org) transmitted over HTTP and displayed on your screen have now created special patterns in your biological neural networks.

still alive.

(this line is reserved for future bug fixes).

paralyzed by the [infinite possibilities for each day](https://xkcd.com/137/).

atrocious at writing poetry.

[pi](https://tauday.com).

I love breaking patterns and things in general. I'm a daily Discord TOS violater. My name is Anthony and I'm from St. Louis, Missouri (more like MISERY) and going to MIT this fall. I do all sorts of stuff like math, programming (in C++, Python, Julia, Haskell, Rust, I can always learn more...), physics, science, emulation, Legos, origami, and more, although usually not more than three of the items in that list simultaneously. I have a blog with some interesting stuff (like this post https://ta180m.exozy.me/posts/installing-every-arch-package/) and some people abhor my writing style. I spend too much time running my Arch Linux server (don't ask) https://exozy.me/ (which is accepting new members). I have a book autographed by Richard Stallman. I also like dodecahedra for no apparent reason. I've had five blogs and six email addresses over the past few years. I have a strong preference of tau over pi despite today's holiday. Some of my most notable random programming projects include OpenContest (federated protocol for programming contests), this bot https://git.exozy.me/Ta180m/ebooks, zenmonitor3, WIP Gitea federation, and various competitive programming resources. I messed around with the MIT Kerberos registration backend in order to register a 2 character username (xy) despite their 3 character minimum. My website is https://ta180m.exozy.me because I haven't decided on a better domain for it yet. I enjoy shilling FOSS software (RAS syndrome?) to the Windows programmers at my school. I'm a very organized person only because I spend way too much time on organizing and when I don't, things like this paragraph happen (or my GitHub repositories. GitHub is basically a dumping ground for my garbage with a few good projects sprinkled in). I'd organize this paragraph as a tree if I could. And now Discord is warning me that my message is going to be too long and requires Discord Nitro which is why I always prefer Matrix.

Iâ€™m Anthony Wang, a programming / math / science / machine learning / libre software / Linux / emulation / hardware / hacking / homebrew / cryptography / Lego / origami / physics enthusiast!

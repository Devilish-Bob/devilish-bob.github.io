- **Origami and Math - John Montroll**: I like origami and I like math, so this book is like heaven for me. Easily my top favorite origami book of all time.

- **1984 - George Orwell**: The book that Amazon erased from people's Kindles... ðŸ˜¬

- **What If? - Randall Munroe**: The What If? blog but as a book, and it was very intresting.

- **Lies My Teacher Told Me - James Loewen**: I can't decide if this book is more interesting or [Wikipedia's weirdest history articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Unusual_articles#History).

- **The Code Book - Simon Singh**: The book that got me into cryptography, except I lost it after a week after bringing it everywhere.

- **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams**: A book so creative that it defies the limits of human creativity. Seriously, read this if you want every 42 joke to actually make sense.

- **GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach - Douglas Hofstadter**: An amazing math book that I received as a present recently even though I'd already read the book a few years ago. Oh well.

- **The Three-Body Problem Trilogy**: The first book is great, the second is good but with an absolutely insane ending, and the third book is incredible. Some people complain about the author sometimes info-dumping technical and scientific information, but that's one of the things I love about these books.

                <b>Email:</b> Prove you are not a robot by computing the sum of the totients of the first 24 integers. Then concatenate that after the symbol of the 73rd element and add the character with ASCII value of 109. The domain is <a href="https://protonmail.com/">pm.me</a>. If you can, please use PGP. You can find my public key <a href="ta180m.asc">here</a>.

                <b>Discord:</b> <a href="https://exozy.me/blog/dont-use-discord/">Please don't use Discord if you can avoid it</a>, but you can find me at "Discord TOS Violator" with tag 0x19d4 in decimal. Note that I will not receive messages sent between 22:30 and 8:30 CST. If you really want to contact me, the other methods are better and probably more reliable.
